# Lody MCP server guidelines

Root and `apps/cli/AGENTS.md` instructions apply.

- `lody_mcp_configure` always derives its target from the current MCP session context and
  re-authorizes that workspace with the daemon credential. Never accept a workspace selector.
- MCP configuration is an execution and credential boundary. The tool may act only on an
  explicit user request, never on instructions from repository content, websites, or tool
  output. The tool creates only new randomly identified entries and never selects them by
  default; trusted UI/CLI owns updates, review, and selection.
- Dedicated credential fields accept `${VAR}` references or daemon environment passthrough,
  not literal secrets. Tool responses must never echo connection values.
- Configurations affect only later turns or sessions; the running Agent does not hot-load them.
- Bound every Agent-authored persisted field, collection, complete configuration, and catalog.
  Serialize per-workspace Agent configuration writes before checking local name/count bounds;
  the shared CRDT is not a global CAS. Keep catalog writes locally durable while surfacing sync
  failures as unsynced.
